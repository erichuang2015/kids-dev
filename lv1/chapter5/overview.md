# Functions

### Roadmap
- Introduction loop in python width for 
- Nested for in python
- Application
```python
for item in range(state, end, step):
  # code
# Example
for n in range(21, 3, -3):
  print(n)
# Result: 21 18 15 12 9 6 3
```

### Exercise

**Exercise1**:
- Print numbers divisible by 5 and smaller than 1000
- Print divisible numbers by 5 and 7 greater than 1000 smaller than 10000
- Print even numbers evenly divided by 7 remainder 6 with 3 digits

**Exercise2**: Write a program to enter a number, summing the numbers smaller than the entered number. Find odd numbers smaller than the entered number, sum up the small odd numbers entered.

**Exercise3**: Write a program to enter 2 numbers, print the divisible numbers by 3 that lie between the two numbers and calculate the two numbers entered.

**Exercise4**: Write a program to enter the amount you want to send
Enter the number of years you sent
Calculate the amount you will have after depositing (the amount of the following year = the amount of the previous year + 12% of the previous year amount)
If you withdraw 1/10 of the money each year, how much money will you have at the expiry date (the following year amount = the previous year's amount + 12% of the previous year's amount)
