**Exercise2**: 
Write a number guessing minigame program, when you start the program will ask the user to enter a positive number from 1-300. Minigames have the following requirements:
Every time the program starts the results need to predict different numbers: 1 <= (predicted number) <= 300
Wrong answer will show "You answered incorrectly x times", with x being the number of incorrect answers; If the answer is five times wrong, it will change the number of results and let the user guess it five times, and notify the user: "You guessed wrong all five times, the results have changed. Please recite" If you pay The approximate number of numbers in the range greater than or less than 10 numbers will clear
Report user as "You guessed it right!".
If the user answers the result correctly, the program will end and the message "You have correctly predicted the number y" will appear, with y being the result of the predicted number
