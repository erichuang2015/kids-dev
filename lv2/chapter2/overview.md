# Functions (continues)

### Roadmap
- Learn about parameters
- Range of variables in the function
- Keyword return and effect

```python
def sum(a, b):
  return a + b

sum(3, 4)

# default parametter
def sum(a = 0, b = 0):
  return a + b
```

### Project: Testing software, Solving math equations
Create function **test(answer_user)**: 
Question contains 5 multiple choice questions and answers
Based on the player's answer that returns "true or false"
